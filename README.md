The codes found here were used in the paper:
"A GREAT model comparison against the cosmological constant"

by Ruben Arjona, Llorenc Espinosa-Portales,Juan Garcia-Bellido and Savvas Nesseris

arXiv:2111.xxxxxx

Notes:
1) The codes have been tested with Mathematica 11.3 on Windows 10.
2) You might need to fix some paths if you get errors like "file not found".
3) It usually helps to quit the kernel when running between sections of the notebooks and/or different notebooks.
4) The chains in /SN_chains and /RA_chains, were made by Savvas Nesseris and Ruben Arjona respectively.

The Mathematica files are labeled as: mcmc_"model"_"H0-prior".nb,
where:
1) The models used are OLCDM, GREAT and the w0waCDM, aka CPL.
2) The H0 priors used are the Riess measurement, the TRGB measurement and none.

The final plots that appear in the paper are in /plots.
